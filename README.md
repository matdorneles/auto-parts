# auto-parts

**Project information**
- Using Typescript and NodeJS.
- Single Page Application to advertise produts, this is originally created as a Auto Parts website but you can use it to anything.

**System information**
- Upon back-end server start, an admin user will be created to manage your website, you change them to whatever you like
- I would recommend to store the Database information, JWT key and Admin user information in `.env` enviroment variables.
